## Introduction for my project

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis", Project 1. 
There are 8 files created for the project: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each.
The scripts assume that dataset is located (unzipped) in your working directory

To run the scripts you need to to the following:

    1. Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to your working directory;
    2. Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
    3. Extract the data into your working directory;
    4. Run the scripts
